<p>Pebble is built atop a number of incredible open source projects. Below you'll find a complete list of all open
    source projects (and their licenses) that we've used to create the app you're currently enjoying. A big thank you
    goes out from Pebble's Android team to all of the contributors of these projects, we couldn't have done it without
    you!</p>

        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
        counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that
        Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
        medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
        conditions:</p></li>

        following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form

<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
    AGREEMENT.</p>

<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>

<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>

<p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
    code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
<p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
<p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
<p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
<p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
    originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
    Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
    Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
    Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
    Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
    are not derivative works of the Program.</p>

<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
    the Program.</p>

<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
    Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
    Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>

<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
    with this Agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
    this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>

<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>

<p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
    source code and object code form.</p>

<p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
    offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
    license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
    such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.</p>

<p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
    grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
    are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.</p>

<p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
    has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
    form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement; and</p>

<p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>

<p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
    all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
    or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
    conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

<p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
    all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

<p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
    Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
    party; and</p>

<p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
    from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
    exchange.</p>

<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

<p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

<p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
    copy of the Program.</p>

<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.</p>

<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
    responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
    like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
    the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
    product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
    potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
    includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
    indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
    against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
    arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
    party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
    acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
    distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
    obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
    relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
    order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
    the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
    Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
    Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
    Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
    expense.</p>

<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
    must pay those damages.</p>

<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
    PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
    OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
    responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
    distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
    exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
    the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
    damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
    interruption of operations.</p>

<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
    NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
    by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
    software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
    Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
    date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
    after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
    under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
    distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
    Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
    Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
    Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
    copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
    Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
    revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
    Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
    Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
    suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
    given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
    Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
    Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
    of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
    Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
    expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
    rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
    this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
    otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
    Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
    the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
    to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
    than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
    rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

    regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p><strong><a name="trademarks">6. Trademarks</a></strong>. This License does not grant
